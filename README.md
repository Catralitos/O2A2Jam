# O2A2Jam

Innerverse is a bitsy-style visual novel about gender identity and self-discovery. Ava is struggling with her identity, depression, and lately, insomnia has been keeping her awake at night. Find out what's keeping her awake, and hopefully she'll finally be able to get a good night's rest.

We developed this game for the O2A2 VN Jam 2023 ~ Queer Edition ~ where we could only use one asset of each type: one sprite, one background, one song, etc... We were heavily restricted, but we overcame the limitations to create something fun.

Programming: Carlos Marques

Writing and Character Art: Sam Costa

Background Art: Jo√£o Batista
